  "<p class='bioP'>Arthur Charles Clarke was a prolific science fiction writer and futurist who came to popularity in the early 1950s, mainly with the publication
  and widespread sale of his novels <span>Childhood's End (1953)</span> and <span>Against the Fall of Night (1956)</span>. Along with Isaac Asimov
  and Robert Heinlein, Clarke is considered to be one of 'The Big Three' of science fiction. He is also famous for having co-written
  the screenplay for Stanley Kubrick's <span>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</span>, which he later wrote into a novel after the film's release.</p>

  <p class='bioP'>Clarke was born in Somerset, England on December 16, 1917, and since boyhood had cultivated a deep passion for astronomy and space travel.
  Clarke later served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War as a radar specialist. During this time, he was involved in
  the early-warning radar defense system, which would later prove critical to the Battle of Britain. After the war, Clarke went on
  to earn a degree in mathematics and physics. Though he is not credited with the conceptualization of geostationary satellites, he is often seen as
  the progenitor of the idea to utilize them for telecommunication purposes, which of course, has now become an extremely common usage scenario.</p>

  <p class='bioP'>Clarke moved to Sri Lanka in 1956. It was here that he wrote one of his most
  famous series, <span>Rendezvous with Rama</span>, the first of which won a number of awards including both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel.
  In 1986, Clarke was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America, and in recognition of his 'services to literature', was made
  a Knight Bachelor on May 26th, 2000.</p>

  <p class='bioP'>Clarke's work has often been seen as 'optimistic' and 'utopian', in which he depicts societies that utilize advanced
  technology for noble pursuits, such as space exploration. Another commonly identified theme is the idea of some form of
  post-human transcendence, in which an intelligent species, either on their own, or through the influence of an alien encounter, evolve into that of a
  god-like species.</p>

  <p class='bioP'>Clarke died in his home on March 19th, 2008 as result of respiratory complications and heart failure linked to post-polio syndrome.
  Just hours before his death, a 7.5 billion year-old gamma ray burst reached Earth from across space. The burst set a new record for the furthest object
  that could be seen with the naked eye. Given it's proximity in time to Clarke's death, it has been regarded by some as a sort of cosmic salute
  to the late science fiction author, and is often referred to as 'The Clarke Event'.</p>";
